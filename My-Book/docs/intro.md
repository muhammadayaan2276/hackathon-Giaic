# About This Book — Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This book explores the future of **Physical AI**, where intelligent systems leave the digital world and operate inside real humanoid robots. Across four modules—**ROS 2 (The Robotic Nervous System)**, **Gazebo & Unity (The Digital Twin)**, **NVIDIA Isaac™ (The AI-Robot Brain)**, and **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**—you will learn how to build, simulate, train, and control an embodied humanoid capable of sensing its environment, understanding human instructions, planning actions, navigating the physical world, and manipulating objects. By the end, you will have the skills to design a humanoid robot that listens, thinks, plans, sees, and acts intelligently.
