## Why I Wrote My Book

I wanted to create a resource that guides learners through the full stack of Physical AI—from robot simulation and middleware to perception and LLM-driven planning.  

This book is perfect for anyone who wants to:

- Understand humanoid robot design
- Simulate robots using ROS 2 and Gazebo
- Explore NVIDIA Isaac and Vision-Language-Action systems

## Interactive Example

You can even try interactive components within this blog:

```js
<button onClick={() => alert('Welcome to My Book!')}>Click me!</button>
