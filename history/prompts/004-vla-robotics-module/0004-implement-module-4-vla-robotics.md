## Details

This PHR documents the implementation of tasks for "Module 4 - Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Robotics". All tasks defined in `specs/001-vla-robotics-module/tasks.md` have been addressed, including the creation and population of three new chapters in the Docusaurus book, as well as quality assurance checks.

Key highlights of the implementation:
-   **Chapter Creation**: Created `chapter1-voice-to-action.md`, `chapter2-llm-planning.md`, and `chapter3-capstone-humanoid.md` within `My-Book/docs/module4-vla/`.
-   **Content Generation**: Each chapter was populated with detailed, beginner-friendly content explaining VLA concepts, LLMs in planning, VLM integration, ROS 2 Actions, and a complete autonomous humanoid pipeline, including conceptual diagrams and Python/rclpy snippets.
-   **Word Count Condensation**: The total word count for Module 4 was successfully condensed from 3739 words to 1966 words, bringing it within the target range of 1500–2500 words.
-   **Docusaurus Configuration**: The `_category_.json` file for `module4-vla` was corrected to ensure proper autogeneration of the sidebar.
-   **Build Verification**: A Docusaurus build was successfully performed to confirm compilation and rendering of the new module.
-   **Code Review**: Conceptual code examples were reviewed for accuracy and reproducibility.
-   **Citations**: Confirmed that no explicit citations were required as per the spec.

All defined tasks in `specs/001-vla-robotics-module/tasks.md` have been marked as completed.
