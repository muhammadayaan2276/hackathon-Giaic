# Data Model: Book Content Structure

This document defines the data model for the content of the book. In this context, the "data model" refers to the standardized structure of a book chapter.

## Entity: Chapter

A `Chapter` is the fundamental unit of content in the book.

### Fields

| Field Name      | Type     | Description                                                                                                 | Required |
| --------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| **Title**       | String   | The main title of the chapter. This will be the `<h1>` of the page.                                          | Yes      |
| **Introduction**| String   | 1-3 paragraphs introducing the topics to be covered in the chapter.                                         | Yes      |
| **Sections**    | Array    | An array of section objects, each with a `heading` (e.g., `<h2>`, `<h3>`) and `content` (Markdown text).       | Yes      |
| **Code Examples** | Array    | An array of code blocks, each with a specified language (e.g., `python`, `bash`) and an optional title.        | No       |
| **Diagrams**    | Array    | An array of Mermaid.js diagram blocks.                                                                      | No       |
| **Conclusion**  | String   | 1-2 paragraphs summarizing the key takeaways from the chapter.                                              | Yes      |
| **Word Count**  | Integer  | The target word count for the chapter, as defined in the `spec.md`.                                         | Yes      |

### State Transitions

A chapter progresses through the following states:

1.  **`specified`**: The chapter's requirements are defined in a `spec.md` file.
2.  **`draft`**: The initial version of the chapter has been generated by the AI.
3.  **`in_review`**: The draft is being reviewed by a human author for technical accuracy and clarity.
4.  **`published`**: The chapter has been approved and is integrated into the main Docusaurus build.

### Validation Rules

-   The `Title` must be unique within a module.
-   The final word count should be within +/- 10% of the target `Word Count`.
-   All `Code Examples` must be runnable and tested.
