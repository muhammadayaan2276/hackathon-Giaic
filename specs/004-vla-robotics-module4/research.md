# Research Findings for Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Robotics Planning

**Purpose**: Document research findings and decisions during the planning phase.
**Created**: 2025-12-10
**Feature**: [specs/001-vla-robotics-module/spec.md](specs/001-vla-robotics-module/spec.md)

## Summary
Based on the feature specification, there are no explicit "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" markers or complex technical unknowns requiring dedicated external research beyond the consolidated information in the `plan.md`. The technologies (Whisper, ROS 2, Nav2, VLMs) are well-established for the target audience.

## Decisions
(Decisions are documented in `plan.md` under the "Decisions" section, derived directly from the feature description.)

## Alternatives Considered
(Alternatives are documented in `plan.md` under the "Decisions" section.)

## Next Steps
Proceed to Phase 1: Design & Contracts.
